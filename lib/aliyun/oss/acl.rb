    # By default buckets are private. This means that only the owner has access rights to the bucket and its objects. 
    # Objects in that bucket inherit the permission of the bucket unless otherwise specified. When an object is private, the owner can 
    # generate a signed url that exposes the object to anyone who has that url. Alternatively, buckets and objects can be given other 
    # access levels. Several canned access levels are defined:
    # 
    # * <tt>:private</tt> - Owner gets FULL_CONTROL. No one else has any access rights. This is the default.
    # * <tt>:public_read</tt> - Owner gets FULL_CONTROL and the anonymous principal is granted READ access. If this policy is used on an object, it can be read from a browser with no authentication.
    # * <tt>:public_read_write</tt> - Owner gets FULL_CONTROL, the anonymous principal is granted READ and WRITE access. This is a useful policy to apply to a bucket, if you intend for any anonymous user to PUT objects into the bucket.
    # 
    # You can set a canned access level when you create a bucket or an object by using the <tt>:access</tt> option:
    # 
    #   OSSObject.store(
    #     'kiss.jpg', 
    #     data, 
    #     'marcel', 
    #     :access => :public_read
    #   )
    # 
    # Since the image we created is publicly readable, we can access it directly from a browser by going to the corresponding bucket name 
    # and specifying the object's key without a special authenticated url:
    # 
    #  http://oss.aliyuncs.com/marcel/kiss.jpg
    # 
    module ACL
      # The ACL::Policy class lets you inspect and modify access controls for buckets and objects.
      # A policy is made up of one or more Grants which specify a permission and a Grantee to whom that permission is granted.
      #
      # Buckets and objects are given a default access policy which contains one grant permitting the owner of the bucket or object
      # FULL_CONTROL over its contents. This means they can read the object, write to the object, as well as read and write its
      # policy.
      #
      # The <tt>acl</tt> method for both buckets and objects returns the policy object for that entity:
      #
      #   grant = Bucket.acl('some-bucket')
      #   grant = Bucket.acl('some-bucket', :public_read)
      #
